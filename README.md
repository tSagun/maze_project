# SDEV 334 Maze Generator Project
This repository contains the files for my maze generator project.
These files were submitted to my instructor for an individual project assignment.

This graph-based maze generator program creates randomized mazes that can be solved using either DFS or BFS traversal.
The program also uses Maven to generate the GUI for this program.

## How to run
* Download/un-zip all files in the repository.
* To run the program:
  * Navigate to the gui folder
  * Run Launcher.java
  * Once the maze generator GUI appears, click on "Generate"
  * Click on either "Solve with DFS" or "Solve with BFS" to see highlighted path of solution
